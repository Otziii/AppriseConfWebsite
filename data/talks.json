    "description": "If you are a developer, you are like a member of the Navy SEALs - you need to arm yourself with a myriad of skills in order to execute your mission successfully. Coupled with the rapid advancement in software and hardware technologies, every day is a learning day.\n\nIn this keynote, veteran author and developer Wei-Meng Lee will share with you his development journey for the past two decades, beginning with his early days as a C developer for Apple System 7, to the current days as a Web3 developer and trainer. Wei-Meng will share his ups and downs for the past 20 years (from the early days of desktop apps development, mobile development, data science, and more recently, blockchain), and how to keep learning in an industry where things get outdated as soon as they are introduced. If you are overwhelmed with new skills to learn, Wei-Meng will share with you some tips on how to learn quickly, and how to keep yourself motivated. If Wei-Meng can do it, so can you!",
