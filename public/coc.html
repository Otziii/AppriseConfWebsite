        <h1>Apprise Conference Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>The Apprise Conference Code of Conduct (inspired by
            <a href="https://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html">JSConf</a> &
            <a href="https://www.java.no/principles">JavaZone</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Apprise strives to make the conference a great experience for everyone.</b> To achieve this goal we have
            created a
            set of principles that will be effective at the conference. <b>All the conference attendees</b> are required
            to
            agree
            with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
        </p>

        <h3>The Quick Version</h3>

        <p>
            Apprise conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
            regardless of
            gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
            race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. In particular, we ask that all refrain
            from
            commentary that unnecessarily targets all of the above both physically and on the online media. We do not
            tolerate any form of harassment against event participants, our members or our partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a
            refund
            at the discretion of the conference organizers. Individuals, groups or companies that have previously
            violated
            the code of conduct, have a history of harassing other individuals, groups or companies in person as well as
            via
            online media can be refused access to the conference.
        </p>

        <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

        <p>
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
            sexual
            images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
            sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
            attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
            images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
            clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem
            appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
            contact a member of conference staff immediately. You can also email us at
            <a href="mailto:contact@apprise.no"> contact@apprise.no</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
            provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
            conference. We value your attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
